# Teknotrek - Electronics Projects

Welcome to the Teknotrek GitHub repository, where I share my passion for electronics. Here, you'll find the design files, schematics, and source code for a variety of projects featured on my Teknotrek YouTube channel. 

Whether you're a hobbyist or an experienced engineer, my projects are designed to be educational and easy to replicate. Each project includes detailed PCB designs, circuit diagrams, and even 3D models for complete transparency. Feel free to explore, contribute, or use these resources for your own builds!

Stay tuned for regular updates and new releases!
